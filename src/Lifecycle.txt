What are 3 the 3 phases in a component's lifecycle?
1)Mounting -> Putting elements into the DOM
2)Updating -> when the component is updated
3)Unmounting -> when a component is removed from the DOM

### Mounting

1)constructor()
2)getDerivedStateFromProps()
3)render() -> this is the method that actually outputs HTML to the DOM
4)componentDidMount() -> called after the component is rendered.
                        This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.


### Updating

1)getDerivedStateFromProps() -> the natural place to set the "state" object based on the initial props
2)shouldComponentUpdate() -> return a Boolean , whether React should continue with the rendering or not
3)render() -> component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes
4)getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
5)componentDidUpdate() -> called after the component is updated in the DOM

### Unmounting

1)componentWillUnmount() -> just before the component is removed from the DOM
